      Technology
    </h2>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-6">
      When we embarked on developing RPG Playbook, we initially created a proof
      of concept using OpenAI's API, leveraging GPT-3.5 Turbo for text
      generation and DALL-E for image creation. However, as we progressed, we
      encountered several challenges that prompted us to reconsider our
      approach.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-6">
      The costs associated with OpenAI's services proved to be prohibitively
      high for our project's scale. Additionally, we faced reliability issues
      that could potentially impact user experience. Perhaps most critically, we
      realized that relying solely on OpenAI's ecosystem made us vulnerable to
      changes in their policies or services
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-6">
      In response to these challenges, we pivoted our technology stack. For
      image generation, we transitioned to Stable Diffusion, implementing a
      custom-trained SDXL model tailored to our specific needs. On the text
      generation front, we opted for a locally running version of Meta's Llama 3
      Instruct model.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm md:text-base mb-6">
      This shift has not only addressed our initial concerns but has also given
      us greater control over our app's core functionalities. By bringing key
      components in-house, we've enhanced our ability to fine-tune performance,
      ensure reliability, and maintain independence from third-party services.
