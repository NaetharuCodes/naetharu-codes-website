Welcome to the first part of our Godot series. In this tutorial we are going to deal with the very basics of getting set up and working with Godot, ready for our first project. I'm going to cover every step, even if they seem basic. Some of you may wish to skip ahead, but I want to make sure that everyone is set up properly and on the same page no matter their skill or experience level.
