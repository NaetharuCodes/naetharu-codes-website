# Naetharu-Codes

Welcome to the repository for Naetharu-Codes, my personal website and blog dedicated to sharing my coding journey, projects, and insights into web development. This site is built with the modern web framework, [Astro](https://astro.build/), leveraging its capabilities for creating fast, SEO-friendly, and content-rich websites.

For dynamic features and interactivity, I've incorporated React components, known as "islands", allowing for a blend of static and dynamic content without compromising on site performance. Styling is meticulously crafted using Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first CSS framework for designing custom and responsive layouts with ease.

## Features

- **Astro Framework**: Utilizes Astro for efficient, scalable, and fast web development.
- **React Island Components**: Enhances interactivity through React-based "islands", enabling dynamic content in a predominantly static site.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employs Tailwind CSS for intuitive and flexible styling, speeding up the design process with utility-first classes.

## Local Development

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naetharu-codes.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd naetharu-codes
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without needing to restart the server.
